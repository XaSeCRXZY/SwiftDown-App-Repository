echo %i% Somebody once told me the world is gonna owe me
echo I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
echo She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
echo In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

echo Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
echo Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
echo Didn't make sense not to live for fun
echo Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
echo So much to do so much to see
echo So what's wrong with taking the back streets
echo You'll never know if you don't go
echo You'll never shine if you don't glow

echo Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
echo Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
echo (And all that glitters is gold)
echo Only shooting stars break the mold

echo It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
echo You're bundled up now, wait 'till you get older
echo But the meteor men beg to differ
echo Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
 
echo The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
echo The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
echo My world's on fire how about yours

echo Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
echo Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid

echo Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas
echo â€œI need to get myself away from this place"
echo I said yep what a concept
echo I could use a little fuel myself
echo And we could all use a little change.
